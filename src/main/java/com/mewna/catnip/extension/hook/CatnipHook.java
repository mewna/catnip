/**
 * A horrible thing that allows you to patch JSON objects and other stuff. This
 * is a horrible idea, but it exists mainly to allow you to hackpatch in things
 * that can't be added / won't be added / just aren't currently in the library.
 * Methods on this class are called <strong>SYNCHRONOUSLY</strong>, and so any
 * implementations of it should take this into consideration.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if you had a message-caching extension, you could use this to
 * inject the cached data into {@code MESSAGE_UPDATE} events, to make the data
 * in the event actually be "complete."
 * <p/>
 * Again, this is a <strong>TERRIBLE</strong> idea. <strong>You should only use
 * this if you have <em>absolutely no other choice</em>.</strong> It is
 * <em>highly</em> recommended that you try to find an alternative to using
 * this.
