# PROJECT STATUS

**This project is no longer maintained.** I don't have time to maintain it anymore, and I don't really use Discord's API much anymore anyway. If you want to maintain this library, please see issue [#729](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/issues/729).

A Discord API wrapper in Java. Fully async / reactive, built on top of
[RxJava](http://reactivex.io). catnip tries to map roughly 1:1 to how the Discord 
API works, both in terms of events and REST methods available. catnip uses Java 17+.

catnip is part of the [amyware Discord server](https://discord.gg/yeF2HpP).

## Features

- Automatic sharding
- Very customizable - you can write [extensions](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/extension/Extension.java)
  for the library, as well as [options](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/CatnipOptions.java)
  for most anything you could want to change. See `EXTENSIONS.md` for more.
- Modular - REST / shards can be used independently. See `MODULAR_USAGE.md` for more.
- Customizable caching - Can run with [no cache](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/cache/NoopEntityCache.java),
  [partial caching](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/cache/CacheFlag.java),
  or [write your own cache handler](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/cache/EntityCacheWorker.java).
  See `CACHING.md` for more.
- Asynchronous cache accesses.
- You can disable individual events.
- You can disable all events, and handle gateway events directly.
- Customizable ratelimit/session data handling - wanna store your 
  [sessions/seqnums](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/shard/session/SessionManager.java) 
  and [REST ratelimit data](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/tree/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/rest/ratelimit)
  in Redis, but [gateway ratelimits](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/shard/ratelimit/Ratelimiter.java)
  in memory? You can do that!
- [Customizable shard management](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/blob/mistress/src/main/java/com/mewna/catnip/shard/manager/ShardManager.java)

## Basic usage

This is the simplest possible bot you can make right now:

```Java
final Catnip catnip = Catnip.catnip("your token goes here");
catnip.observable(DiscordEvent.MESSAGE_CREATE)
    .filter(msg -> msg.content().equals("!ping"))
    .subscribe(msg -> {
        msg.respond("pong!");
    }, error -> error.printStackTrace());
catnip.connect();
```

catnip returns RxJava operators (`Completable`/`Observable`/`Single`/...) from
all REST methods. For example, editing your ping message to include time it
took to create the message:

```Java
final Catnip catnip = Catnip.catnip("your token goes here");
catnip.observable(DiscordEvent.MESSAGE_CREATE)
        .filter(msg -> msg.content().equals("!ping"))
        .subscribe(msg -> {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
            msg.respond("pong!")
                    .subscribe(ping -> {
                        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                        ping.edit("pong! (took " + (end - start) + "ms).");
                    });
        }, error -> error.printStackTrace());
catnip.connect();
```

You can also create a catnip instance asynchronously:

```Java
Catnip.catnipAsync("your token here").subscribe(catnip -> {
    catnip.observable(DiscordEvent.MESSAGE_CREATE)
        .filter(msg -> msg.content().equals("!ping"))
        .subscribe(msg -> {
            msg.respond("pong!");
        }, error -> error.printStackTrace());
    catnip.connect();
});
```

Also check out the [examples](https://github.com/mewna/catnip/tree/mistress/src/main/example/basic) for Kotlin and Scala usage.

### A note on Observable#subscribe vs. Observable#forEach

`Observable#forEach` seems like the obvious way to use the reactive methods, but as it turns out,
it's also the wrong thing to do. `Observable#forEach` is generally intended for finite streams of
data; the events that catnip emits aren't finite, and as such, `Observable#forEach` isn't the
correct tool to use. In addition, **`Observable#forEach` will stop processing events if an uncaught
exception is thrown.** Instead, you should use `Observable#subscribe(eventCallback, exceptionCallback)`,
which will handle exceptions properly.

### Modular usage

catnip supports being used in REST-only or shards-only configurations. The nice thing about catnip
is that using it like this is **exactly the same** as using it normally. The only difference is
that to use catnip in REST-only mode, you don't call `catnip.connect()` and use 
`catnip.rest().whatever()` instead. 

### RxJava schedulers

By default, RxJava's `Observable#subscribe()` and related methods will not operate on any
particular scheduler by default. That is, they will run on the calling thread. catnip will
automatically subscribe RxJava objects onto a scheduler provided by catnip, that defaults
to being a ForkJoinPool-based scheduler. You can customize the scheduler used with the
corresponding option in `CatnipOptions`.

## Useful extensions

- `catnip-voice` - Voice support for your catnip bot. 
  https://github.com/natanbc/catnip-voice
- `catnip-utilities` - Some extensions for typesafe commands, event waiters, reaction menus, 
  and more. https://github.com/queer/catnip-utilities 
- `discordbotlist-stats-catnip` - Wrapper aiming at combining all Discord Bot Lists AND Wrappers into one artifact.
  Automatically handles pushing bot stats to bot lists. https://github.com/burdoto/discordbotlist-stats#using-with-catnip--

## Why write a fourth Java lib?

- I didn't want ten billion events for every possible case. catnip maps more/less 1:1 with the
  Discord API, and any "extra" events on top of that need to be user-provided via extensions or
  other means. I guess really I just didn't want my lib to be as "high-level" as other libs are.
- I wanted to try to maximize extensibility / customizability, beyond just making it modular. Things
  like being able to intercept raw websocket messages (as JSON), write custom distributed cache handlers,
  ... are incredibly useful.
- I like everything returning Rx classes instead of custom `Future`-like classes. I do get why other libs
  have them, I just wanted to not.
- I wanted modular usage to be exactly the same more / less no matter what; everything
  should be doable through the catnip instance that you create.
- I wanted to make a lib built on RxJava.
- To take over the world and convert all Java bots. :^)
